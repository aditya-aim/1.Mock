    {
        "candidate": "Built AI apps with TensorFlow/PyTorch, including an NLP chatbot. Optimized performance and reduced latency via fine-tuning and quantization."
    },
    {
        "interviewer": "Thank you for sharing your experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch. To get a better sense of your expertise, could you tell me more about the NLP chatbot project you mentioned? Specifically, what was the primary goal of the chatbot, and what role did you play in its development?"
    },
    {
        "candidate": "The goal was automated customer support. I trained the NLP model, fine-tuned transformers, and optimized performance."
    },
    {
        "interviewer": "Based on your experience with training NLP models and optimizing performance, could you explain how you approach debugging issues in your AI applications? Are there specific tools or techniques you find particularly helpful?"
    },
    {
        "candidate": "I use logging, model checkpoints, and visualization tools like TensorBoard. For debugging, I analyze loss curves, check data preprocessing, and run ablation tests."
    },
